# DisneyMovieRandomizer

Small Python project to kick-off #100daysofcode

As a parent to a small child during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place, I had the idea to create a small script that parses a .json file of Disney movies, picks a movie at random, then prints the value into the console. 

Later on, I might expand on the project by building a simple GUI with tkinter, but for now I do enjoy how it turned out.
